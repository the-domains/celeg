#### Helping Barco with Scrum

I started working for Barco on the Cinecare team. That team already started with Scrum but after I gave them a Scrum intro training they realised there were many things that could be improved. I helped them to to take their Scrum way of working to the next level.  
After this first assignment at Barco I also coached teams in Li√®ge, Kortrijk, Karlsruhe and Noida on Scrum and Agile in general.
