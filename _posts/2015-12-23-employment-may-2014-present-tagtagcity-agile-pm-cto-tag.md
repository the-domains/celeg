MAY 2014 - PRESENT TagTagCity - Agile PM - CTO TagTagCity is a small startup that has 2 products: a mobile web site generator (mobiloptim.com) and a native mobile app for municipalities (mobicities.be) In my role as Agile PM and CTO I define the roadmap for the product in collaboration with the company's board of directors and I plan and follow up the work together with the team. I am also responsible for the technical decisions regarding the product. We use Scrum as a methodology and work in weekly sprints. From a technology perspective we use PHP and the Laravel framework and run both of our products on the Azure cloud.
