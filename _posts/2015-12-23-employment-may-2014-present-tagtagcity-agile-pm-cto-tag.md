TagTagCity - Agile PM - CTO TagTagCity is a small startup that has 2 products: a mobile web site generator (mobiloptim.com) and a native mobile app for municipalities (mobicities.be) In my role as Agile PM and CTO I define the roadmap for the product in collaboration with the company's board of directors and I plan and follow up the work together with the team. I am also responsible for the technical decisions regarding the product. We use Scrum as a methodology and work in weekly sprints. From a technology perspective we use PHP and the Laravel framework and run both of our products on the Azure cloud.

MAY 2013 - APRIL 2014

### RealDolmen

#### Unit Manager / Scrum coach

In May 2013 I joined RealDolmen as a unit manager of the Microsoft Competence Center. In that role I was responsible for a group of 80 Microsoft consultants. My main activities were competence development, recruitment, resource planning, budgeting and forecasting, (pre)sales.  
Next to that I was active as a Scrum coach and trainer. I continued to work for Barco to help them to roll out Scrum in a large division spread over different countries.
