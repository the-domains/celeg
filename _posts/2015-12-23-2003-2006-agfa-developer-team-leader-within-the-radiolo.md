2003 - 2006 AGFA Developer - Team leader Within the radiology information systems product team my team was responsible for the reporting and speech modules. Reporting in this sense must be seen as the activities a radiologist performs on a radiological study. In this process the radiologist can be assisted by speech technology. My team was responsible for the analysis and development of new features in that area of the product, the integration with the third party speech API (Philips). I was the team leader of the development team. In that role I took part in the development of the solution, but also coached the other developers and acted as a single point of contact for the stakeholders of our team (testing, helpdesk, and product managers)
