In May 2013 I joined RealDolmen as a unit manager of the Microsoft Competence Center. In that role I was responsible for a group of 80 Microsoft consultants. My main activities were competence development, recruitment, resource planning, budgeting and forecasting, (pre)sales.

Next to that I was active as a Scrum coach and trainer. I continued to work for Barco to help them to roll out Scrum in a large division spread over different countries.
