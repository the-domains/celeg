Working in software development since the year 2000 in a variety of different roles. Ever since the start of my career I have been in software development. I started as a functional analyst without any development background and then moved on to learn how to code in C\#. Pretty early already I got bitten by the Agile way of doing projects. The first Agile project I did as a PM / Scrum Master (what's in a name) was back in 2006 and since then I have always been involved in Agile projects. Later on I also started coaching Agile teams that were making the transition from the traditional way of building software. Currently I am working as an Agile PM / CTO for a small startup. That is a pretty broad role. It involves defining the roadmap for the product, helping the team with the planning, but also helping the team with technical architecture choices and even writing some code in PHP.
